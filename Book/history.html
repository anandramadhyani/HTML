                            The series is set in an ancient Indian kingdom and follows the story of a tribal leader named Shiva who discovers that he is the prophesied savior of the kingdom and must fight against the evil Nagas to save his people. Along the way, Shiva discovers secrets about his past, learns about the power of good and evil and ultimately becomes a god-like figure in the eyes of his people.

                            The Palace of Illusions traces the princess Panchaali's life, beginning with her birth in fire and following her spirited balancing act as a woman with five husbands who have been cheated out of their father's kingdom. Panchaali is swept into their quest to reclaim their birthright, remaining at their side through years of exile and a terrible civil war involving all the important kings of India. Meanwhile, we never lose sight of her strategic duels with her mother-in-law, her complicated friendship with the enigmatic Krishna, or her secret attraction to the mysterious man who is her husbands' most dangerous enemy. Panchaali is a fiery female redefining for us a world of warriors, gods, and the ever-manipulating hands of fate.
