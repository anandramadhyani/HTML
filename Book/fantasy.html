                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Divided into twelve districts and ruled by the oppressive Capitol, the series revolves around the life of Katniss Everdeen. When Katniss volunteers to participate in the annual Hunger Games to save her sister, she becomes an unexpected symbol of rebellion against the Capitol's tyranny. <br>

                            Throughout the trilogy, themes of social inequality, government control, personal sacrifice, and the power of resilience take center stage. The narrative explores Katniss's evolution from a reluctant fighter to a reluctant symbol of hope and defiance. The series combines intense action, emotional depth, and ethical dilemmas, culminating in a battle for justice and freedom that challenges the very foundations of Panem's society.
