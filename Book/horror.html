                        Welcome to Derry, Maine ...
                        <br><br>
                        It's a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. Only in Derry the haunting is real ...
                        <br><br>
                        They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. Now they are grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to gain success and happiness. But none of them can withstand the force that has drawn them back to Derry to face the nightmare without an end, and the evil without a name.

                        One by one, they will get what they deserve...
                        <br><br>
                        A night spent sleeping on dirt and leaves is not how Claire Matchett expected to spend her vacation.
                        <br><br>
                        She thought this would be a break from the stresses of work and raising her young children. A chance to repair her damaged marriage. A week of hiking and hot tubs with two other couple friends. It sounded like heaven.
                        <br><br>
                        Then Claire's minivan breaks down on a lonely dirt road. With no cell reception, the group has no choice but to hike the rest of the way to their hotel. But it turns out the woods aren't as easy to navigate as they thought.
                        <br><br>
                        Hours later, they are lost. Hopelessly lost.
                        <br><br>
                        And as they navigate deeper into the woods, the members of their party are struck down mysteriously one by one. Has a wild animal been hunting them? Or is the hunter one of them?
                        <br><br>
                        But as more time passes, one thing becomes clear:
                        <br><br>
                        Only one of them will return home alive.

                        A rural country road. No cell signal for miles. A terrifying game of cat-and-mouse.
                        <br><br>
                        By the time Laura and Olivia notice the headlights tailing them through the hills, it's too late. What seems, at first, like a case of road rage quickly unfolds into a heart-pounding chase—and a battle for survival.
                        <br><br>
                        Who are the men in the truck? What do they want? And can Laura and Olivia outrun—and outsmart—them long enough to call for help, even if it means taking their chances in the hills on foot?
                        <br><br>
                        As their situation grows more perilous, the girls realize that the real terror has only just begun. But flight won't save them from their pursuers. If they're going to make it home alive, they'll have to fight.
